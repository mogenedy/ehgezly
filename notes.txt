### Requirements ###
### Suggestions for added features ####
 - Add Categories
 - Add Search

 ### Assumptions ####
- Each service is available every day from defined start time to defined end time
- Each service can reserved only once at the same time

I as a user want to reserve service A tomorrow at 10AM
    What makes it available at this time
    10AM is within its availability window
    And no other reservation is at that time for that service

Service reservation duration -> each service has a duration?


I as a user want to reserve service A, what is the flow?
Choose date -> see list of available times -> choose time -> select

How will we show available times?

Tables
- services
        -> duration (In minutes)
        -> available_from
        -> available_to
        -> [optional] cancellation_cutoff_hours

- reservations
        -> service_id
        -> user_id
        -> date_from
        -> date_to


Example reservation flow: (User perespective)
    -> User asks for consultation service
    -> User chooses a date (17/01/2025)
    -> User sees a list of available times
            -> 10AM
            -> 11AM
            -> 01PM

Example reservation flow: (System perespective)
    -> How available times are calculated
        -> Get consultation available_from, available_to and duration (10:18), duration: 1hour
        -> Create a list of all available points of time
            -> 10
            -> 11
            -> 12
            -> 13
            -> 14
            -> 15
            -> 16
            -> 17
        -> Get all reservations for consultation service at 17/01/2025
            -> then we have a list of occupied from and to
                    -> 10:11
                    -> 13:14
        -> Update the available points of time to exclude reserved times
              -> 11
              -> ....
              -> ...
